Vendored Modules
================

If you are planning to submit a Pull Request against any of the libraries in the
``vendor/`` directory than do not go any further. These are independent libraries
which are vendored into Artisan. Any changes to these libraries should be made in
their respective upstream repository and then will be propagated here.

The exception to the above rule is ``pyvbox``, see below for explanation.

List of Vendored Modules
------------------------

 - pyvbox (1.0.0) (`GitHub <https://github.com/mjdorma/pyvbox>`_)

Notes on `pyvbox` Module
------------------------
It appears that ``pyvbox`` is not currently maintained. Last release was a year ago.
All changes *should* be submitted against their `GitHub repository <https://github.com/mjdorma/pyvbox>`_
but it seems that there is slim chance of getting a new release.
