Vendored Modules
================

If you are planning to submit a Pull Request against any of the libraries in the
``vendor/`` directory than do not go any further. These are independent libraries
which are vendored into Artisan. Any changes to these libraries should be made in
their respective upstream repository and then will be propagated here.

Pull requests for ``distro`` should go here: https://github.com/nir0s/distro/pulls
